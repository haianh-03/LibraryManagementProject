# LibraryManagementProject

**Project Description**

The Library Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of library operations. It provides comprehensive features for managing books, customers, and book rental services, while also supporting librarian administration with functions such as attendance tracking, leave management, and payroll processing.

This project aims to replace traditional manual management methods, which are often time-consuming, difficult to monitor, and prone to human error. By digitizing and automating key processes, the system enhances efficiency, improves accuracy, and ensures better control over library activities.
